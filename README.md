# LuaPython
Lua is condidered one of the most underrated langages but is great in so many ways it has a nice english like sintax and a intermpeter that is faster than python with olney 22 key words compared to pythons 33. the problem is lua is not that well known so with this package you can enter lua mode and write lua code in a python file you can exit lua mode and write python code, but you can use data from the lua code and implament it in your python and use python libaires with your lua code.
